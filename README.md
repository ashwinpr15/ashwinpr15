## 🚀 What I Do

I build **data systems that ship**, turning messy enterprise data into forecasting models, cloud pipelines, and BI platforms that executives trust under real-world constraints.

I lead analytics engineering and data science initiatives at **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)**, delivering production-grade solutions for Fortune 500 clients including **Stellantis, Samsung, and Bosch**.

**Now:** Predictive supply chain modeling | Cloud-native data platforms | Preparing for **Fall 2026** graduate programs in **Data/Business Analytics / MIS**
**GRE:** 339/340 (Q:169 | V:170)

---

## 🎯 Current Focus (2026)

* 📦 Shipping **predictive supply chain and inventory forecasting models** on Azure
* 📊 Designing **executive-grade BI dashboards** (Power BI + Fabric) with performance-first DAX
* 🔄 Engineering **scalable ETL pipelines** using Azure Data Factory and Snowflake
* 📚 Deepening expertise in **AI strategy and analytics leadership** for graduate study
