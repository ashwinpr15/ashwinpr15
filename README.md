## 🚀 What I Do

I build **data systems that ship**, turning messy enterprise data into forecasting models, cloud pipelines, and BI platforms that executives actually trust.

Currently, I lead analytics engineering and data science initiatives at **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)**, delivering production-grade solutions for Fortune 500 clients including **Stellantis, Samsung, and Bosch**.

**Right now:** Predictive supply chain modeling | Cloud-native data platforms | Preparing for **Fall 2026** graduate programs in **Business Analytics / MIS**

**GRE:** 339/340 (Q:169 | V:170)

---

## 🎯 Current Focus (2026)

* 📦 Building **predictive supply chain and inventory forecasting models** on Azure
* 📊 Designing **executive-grade BI dashboards** with Power BI and Fabric
* 🔄 Engineering **scalable ETL pipelines** using Azure Data Factory and Snowflake
* 📚 Deepening expertise in **AI strategy and analytics leadership** for graduate study

---

## 📊 Production Impact (2022–2025)

*Enterprise production work governed by NDAs. Impact metrics verified through delivery records.*

### **Supply Chain Optimization** | Stellantis NV

Built a real-time Power BI dashboard integrated with Azure SQL to monitor global logistics operations.

* **Impact:** 20% reduction in annual logistics overhead, real-time visibility across regions

### **Demand Forecasting** | Samsung & Bosch

Developed Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models to forecast inventory demand.

* **Impact:** 15–20% improvement in forecast accuracy, reducing overstock and holding costs

### **Cloud Data Migration & ETL** | Multi-Client

Architected Azure Data Factory pipelines to migrate legacy on-prem systems to cloud platforms.

* **Impact:** 30% faster data processing and 99.9% data availability for reporting teams

### **Recognition**

🏆 **6× “Star of the Month” (TCS)** for delivery excellence and client impact

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (By Problem Domain)

**Data Science & ML**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), R, TensorFlow, XGBoost, Random Forest

**Business Intelligence**
Power BI, Tableau, QlikView, DAX, Advanced Excel

**Data Engineering**
Azure Data Factory, PySpark, Snowflake, BigQuery, SQL Server

**Cloud & DevOps**
Microsoft Fabric, Azure Synapse Analytics, Git

**Principle:** I prioritize tools that **ship fast and scale reliably**, not tools that just look good on a résumé.
